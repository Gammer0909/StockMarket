## Stock Market Simulator

Stock Market Simulator is a little game I made with C#.
It's a very simple game where you can buy and sell stocks, and you can see how much money you have, and how much money you've made.
I plan on adding more features to the game, like 

1. A backend system connected to Google Sheets (A jank database kinda thing)
2. A GUI (Sometime in the future)
3. Connection to an actual stock API instead of just randomly generating prices every turn

## Installation

No clue how to install this, I'm not a professional programmer, I just do this for fun. If you know how to compile C# code, then you can probably figure it out.

I think you can just download the .exe file and run it, but I'm not sure.

(The .exe is in bin\Debug\net7.0\StockMarket.exe)
