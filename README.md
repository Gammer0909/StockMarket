## Stock Market Simulator

Stock Market Simulator is a simple game where you can buy and sell stocks, and see how much money you have and how much money you've made. The game is written in C#.

### How to Play

To play the game, simply run the executable file located at `bin\Debug\net7.0\StockMarket.exe`. Once the game is running, you can buy and sell stocks by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the GUI. You can also view your current balance and the current prices of the stocks.

### Future Features

In the future, we plan on adding the following features to the game:

1. A backend system connected to Google Sheets, which will allow you to save your progress and view your stats across multiple devices.
2. A GUI, which will make it easier to interact with the game and view your stats.
3. Connection to an actual stock API, which will provide more realistic stock prices and allow you to trade real stocks.

### Installation

To compile and run the code, you will need to have C# installed on your machine. Once you have C# installed, you can download the source code and compile it using your preferred IDE or command line tool.
